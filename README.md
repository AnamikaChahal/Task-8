# Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Exploration

## Objective

The goal of this task is to understand how a Virtual Private Network (VPN) enhances online privacy and security. This includes setting up a VPN, verifying IP masking and encryption, and researching VPN protocols and limitations.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- IP Masking
- Encryption and Tunneling
- VPN Protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc.)
- Privacy Protection
- VPN Limitations

---

## Tools Used

- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- whatismyipaddress.com
- Browser and Internet Speed Test Tool

---

## Steps Followed

1. Chose ProtonVPN as a trusted free VPN provider and created an account.
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN desktop client.
3. Connected to the nearest VPN server.
4. Verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com before and after connection.
5. Confirmed encrypted traffic by browsing securely.
6. Disconnected VPN and compared speed and IP before and after.
7. Researched how VPNs ensure privacy and their encryption standards.
8. Documented all observations and included screenshots.

## VPN Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits

- Hides real IP address, enabling anonymous browsing.
- Encrypts internet traffic, protecting data on public Wi-Fi.
- Bypasses geographic restrictions.
- Prevents ISP tracking and logging.

### Limitations

- Free VPNs often have limited server choices and slower speeds.
- VPNs cannot protect against malware or phishing.
- Complete anonymity is not guaranteed if logs are kept.
- Certain websites or services may block known VPN IP ranges.
